// write your code below

//In this exercise we will review a simple math concept, table of 9.

//#### instructions
//1. Write a `for loop` that will iterate from 0 to 10.
//2. `For each` iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9.
//3. `Log` the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

//## Optional: Table of all numbers from 1 to 9
//Write a function that gives the table of any number that you pass to it.

//Have a good time, and don't get crazy with math
var num12 = 9;
for (x = 0 ; x <= 10; x++ ){
    var result = x * num12
   console.log(x + "*" + num12+ "=" + result)
}
function kha(num1){
for (x = 0 ; x <= 10; x++ ){
    var result1 = x * num1
   console.log(x + "*" + num1+ "=" + result1)
}}
kha(2)
